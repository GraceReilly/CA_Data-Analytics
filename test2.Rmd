**Abstract**

The aim of this study was to determine which, if any is an effective treatment in PTSD patients. The study divided 150 patients (M= 75, F=75) into 3 groups using random sampling dependent on the type of treatment they would receive; Control (traditional CBT, no VR), Static (non-animated model content, VR), Animated (animated model content, VR). Treatment consisted of a 50 minute session weekly with their therapist over 12 weeks.
PTSD measurements for all groups were measured using the observer-rated and self-report mechanisms. Measurements were taken at the start and end of the study. The main findings include patients OR and CPSS-SR were significantly decreased post treatment. Graph X shows that the OR and CPSS-SR measurements are very closely related. Furthermore X appears to be the most effective for the treatment of PTSD.  

**Introduction**

â€“ Rationale & Hypothesis

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is observed in humans that have been exposed to a
horrifying event, through direct experience or witness of such event. Symptoms might
include vivid flashbacks, nightmares, intense distress and severe anxiety. The rationale
behind this study is to understand what the most effective treatment is for PTSD in adults
aged 18-25. The hypothesis states that X is the most effective treatment of PTSD.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
